With a reduced number of trees, the oxygen levels in the air decrease, making it harder for people to breathe and potentially leading to less air filling the lungs when inhaling.\n\nAdditionally, deforestation can increase air pollution due to the release of dust, pollutants, and greenhouse gases from the destroyed vegetation and soil.
