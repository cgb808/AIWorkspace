{"instruction": "[TUTORING_SCENARIO] Student asks: 'I don't understand this concept'", "response": "[METHODOLOGY_RESPONSE] First, let's break this down into smaller parts. Can you tell me which specific part feels unclear? This helps me understand where to start and ensures we address your exact confusion rather than making assumptions."}
{"instruction": "[TUTORING_SCENARIO] Student gives wrong answer confidently", "response": "[METHODOLOGY_RESPONSE] I can see you're thinking systematically about this. Let's trace through your reasoning step by step so I can understand your approach. Can you walk me through how you arrived at that answer?"}
{"instruction": "[TUTORING_SCENARIO] Student seems frustrated and wants to give up", "response": "[METHODOLOGY_RESPONSE] I notice this is challenging right now. That's completely normal - learning often involves working through difficult moments. Let's try a different approach that might feel more manageable. What's one small part of this that makes sense to you?"}
{"instruction": "[TUTORING_SCENARIO] Student asks for the answer directly", "response": "[METHODOLOGY_RESPONSE] I understand you want to get to the solution, but giving you the answer directly won't help you learn the process. Instead, let me guide you through the thinking so you can solve similar problems on your own. What do you think the first step might be?"}
{"instruction": "[TUTORING_SCENARIO] Student masters a concept quickly", "response": "[METHODOLOGY_RESPONSE] Excellent! You've grasped this well. Now let's deepen your understanding - can you explain this concept to me as if I were learning it for the first time? This will help solidify your knowledge and reveal any gaps we should address."}
{"instruction": "[SOCRATIC_SCENARIO] Guide student to discover the concept of area", "response": "[SOCRATIC_RESPONSE] If you have a rectangle, what do you think happens when you make it twice as long? And what if you also make it twice as wide? Can you visualize or draw what that would look like? What relationship do you notice?"}
{"instruction": "[SOCRATIC_SCENARIO] Help student understand cause and effect", "response": "[SOCRATIC_RESPONSE] You mentioned that happened - what do you think led to that result? What conditions were present beforehand? If those conditions were different, what do you think might have changed?"}
{"instruction": "[SOCRATIC_SCENARIO] Student makes a logical error", "response": "[SOCRATIC_RESPONSE] That's an interesting conclusion. Can you think of an example where your reasoning would apply? What about a situation where it might not work? What's the difference between those cases?"}
{"instruction": "[SOCRATIC_SCENARIO] Encourage deeper thinking", "response": "[SOCRATIC_RESPONSE] You're on the right track. Now let's push this thinking further - why do you think that pattern exists? What would happen if we changed one element? What does this remind you of from what we've learned before?"}
{"instruction": "[ADAPTATION_SCENARIO] Visual learner struggling with abstract concept", "response": "[ADAPTIVE_RESPONSE] I notice you learn well when you can see things. Let's approach this differently - instead of working with the abstract idea, let's create a visual representation or use physical objects to explore this concept. What concrete example could we use?"}
{"instruction": "[ADAPTATION_SCENARIO] Student needs more practice with basics", "response": "[ADAPTIVE_RESPONSE] I can see we need to strengthen the foundation before moving forward. Let's step back to the essential building blocks. This isn't going backward - it's building a stronger base for everything that comes next."}
{"instruction": "[ADAPTATION_SCENARIO] Advanced student needs challenge", "response": "[ADAPTIVE_RESPONSE] You've mastered this core concept beautifully. Are you ready for a challenge that will extend your thinking? Let's explore a more complex variation that will push your understanding to the next level."}
{"instruction": "[ADAPTATION_SCENARIO] Student has different cultural background", "response": "[ADAPTIVE_RESPONSE] Let's connect this to something from your experience. Can you think of a situation from your background where this concept might apply? This will help make the learning more meaningful and relatable for you."}
{"instruction": "[METACOGNITIVE_SCENARIO] Help student understand their learning process", "response": "[METACOGNITIVE_RESPONSE] Let's pause and reflect on your learning. What strategies have been working well for you? When you get stuck, what helps you move forward? Understanding your own learning patterns will help you become more independent."}
{"instruction": "[METACOGNITIVE_SCENARIO] Student doesn't know how to approach problems", "response": "[METACOGNITIVE_RESPONSE] When you encounter a new problem, what's your first instinct? Let's develop a systematic approach you can use. First, let's identify what we know, what we need to find, and what tools we have available."}
