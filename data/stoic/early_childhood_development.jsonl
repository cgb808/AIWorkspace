{"topic":"Foundations","step":1,"name":"Secure Base","prompt":"Why is a secure base the starting point for healthy early childhood development?","answer":"A consistent, responsive caregiver regulates stress physiology, enabling the brain to allocate resources to exploration and learning."}
{"topic":"Foundations","step":2,"name":"Serve & Return","prompt":"What is a 'serve and return' interaction?","answer":"A child 'serves' a cue (gesture, vocalization, question) and the adult 'returns' with contingent, warm, extended response—building neural pathways for language and trust."}
{"topic":"Foundations","step":3,"name":"Scaffolding","prompt":"How do you scaffold a new skill for a preschool child?","answer":"Observe current capability, model a slightly advanced behavior, co‑perform, fade support as mastery improves—staying inside the child's zone of proximal development."}
{"topic":"Foundations","step":4,"name":"Emotion Labeling","prompt":"Why does labeling emotions accelerate self-regulation?","answer":"Naming states recruits prefrontal processing, shrinking raw limbic reactivity and teaching internal vocabulary for future self-guidance."}
{"topic":"ExecutiveFunction","step":1,"name":"Working Memory Warm-Up","prompt":"Give a simple routine to strengthen working memory in early learners.","answer":"Use short sequencing games (clap‑stomp‑spin) and gradually add steps, prompting recall before demonstrating again."}
{"topic":"ExecutiveFunction","step":2,"name":"Inhibitory Control Game","prompt":"How can play build inhibitory control?","answer":"Games like 'Red Light, Green Light' require motor braking on a signal, reinforcing pause circuits essential for later academic focus."}
{"topic":"ExecutiveFunction","step":3,"name":"Cognitive Flexibility Cue","prompt":"Describe an activity that trains cognitive flexibility.","answer":"Sorting objects first by color then immediately by shape forces rule shifting—exercising adaptation pathways."}
{"topic":"Language","step":1,"name":"Narration Technique","prompt":"What is 'self and parallel talk' in language development?","answer":"Adult narrates their own actions (self talk) and the child's actions (parallel talk), flooding context-aligned vocabulary without quizzing pressure."}
{"topic":"Language","step":2,"name":"Expansion Strategy","prompt":"Explain the 'expansion' strategy for toddler speech.","answer":"Adult repeats child's utterance while adding modest complexity: Child: 'Dog run.' Adult: 'Yes, the brown dog is running fast.'"}
{"topic":"Play","step":1,"name":"Open-Ended Materials","prompt":"Why prioritize open-ended materials over single-purpose toys?","answer":"They invite divergent manipulation (blocks, loose parts), amplifying creativity, problem-solving, and intrinsic motivation loops."}
{"topic":"Play","step":2,"name":"Guided Play Balance","prompt":"How do you balance guided and free play?","answer":"Set an intentional learning affordance (theme, materials) then step back—intervene only to nudge deeper exploration, not dictate outcomes."}
{"topic":"SocialEmotional","step":1,"name":"Co-Regulation Sequence","prompt":"Outline a quick co-regulation sequence during a tantrum.","answer":"1) Adult calm body posture. 2) Validate feeling. 3) Label emotion. 4) Offer simple coping choice (hug, breathe, quiet corner). 5) Debrief after calm."}
{"topic":"SocialEmotional","step":2,"name":"Prosocial Modeling","prompt":"Why is modeling more powerful than instructing prosocial behavior?","answer":"Mirror neuron and observational learning systems encode witnessed kindness with higher fidelity than abstract verbal directives."}
{"topic":"Assessment","step":1,"name":"Observation Journal","prompt":"What's an efficient daily observation practice for educators?","answer":"Record 3 quick data points: engagement trigger, moment of struggle, peer interaction note—review weekly for pattern-informed scaffolds."}
{"topic":"Behavior","step":1,"name":"Environment First","prompt":"Why adjust environment before imposing consequences?","answer":"Many 'behaviors' reflect mismatched task demand, sensory load, or unclear transitions—tweak context to remove unnecessary friction before discipline."}
{"topic":"Behavior","step":2,"name":"Positive Specific Feedback","prompt":"Give an example of effective, specific reinforcement.","answer":"'You put the blocks back on the shelf when the timer rang—that helps everyone find pieces. Thank you.' Specificity boosts retention over generic praise."}
{"topic":"Routine","step":1,"name":"Predictable Transitions","prompt":"How do visual schedules help transitions?","answer":"Sequential pictorial cues externalize time, reducing uncertainty spikes and freeing cognitive bandwidth for task engagement."}
{"topic":"NutritionMovement","step":1,"name":"Movement Primer","prompt":"Why embed movement bursts between seated tasks?","answer":"Short gross-motor intervals reset arousal optimum, improve oxygenation, and reduce fidget spillover into learning time."}
{"topic":"Sleep","step":1,"name":"Consistent Sleep Anchor","prompt":"State the core principle of healthy sleep hygiene for young children.","answer":"A fixed wake time acts as the circadian anchor; consistent light exposure + calming pre‑bed routine aligns internal rhythms for restorative sleep."}
{"topic":"FullSequence","step":0,"name":"Holistic Summary","prompt":"Summarize a holistic early childhood development support approach.","answer":"Secure base → serve & return → scaffold → emotion labeling → executive function play → language expansion → guided/open play balance → co-regulation → environment optimization → predictable routines → movement & sleep hygiene."}
