{"framework":"StoicResponse","step":1,"name":"Pause & Separate","prompt":"What is the first step of the 3-Step Stoic Response to Adversity?","answer":"Step 1: Pause & Separate. Momentarily do nothing; distinguish the raw event from the story you are telling yourself so judgment becomes objective."}
{"framework":"StoicResponse","step":2,"name":"Sort & Discard","prompt":"How do you apply the second step (Sort & Discard) in the Stoic response?","answer":"List what is controllable (your judgments, choices, effort) vs. uncontrollable (others' actions, weather, past). Release anxiety about the latter; narrow focus to your sphere of control."}
{"framework":"StoicResponse","step":3,"name":"Action & Virtue","prompt":"What is the purpose of the Action & Virtue step?","answer":"Convert clarity into disciplined movement: select the most rational, courageous, and integrity-aligned action now, turning adversity into practice of virtue."}
{"framework":"StoicResponse","step":0,"name":"Full Sequence","prompt":"Summarize the full 3-Step Stoic Response to Adversity succinctly.","answer":"Pause & Separate (objective view) → Sort & Discard (focus on control) → Action & Virtue (deliberate response)."}
{"framework":"ProblemSolving4","step":1,"name":"Define the Real Problem","prompt":"Why is precisely defining the real problem Step 1 in the 4-Part Framework?","answer":"A sharply worded single-sentence root problem prevents solving superficial symptoms; repeated 'why' drilling exposes leverage and halves the solution effort."}
{"framework":"ProblemSolving4","step":2,"name":"List All Possible Paths","prompt":"What happens in Step 2 (List All Possible Paths)?","answer":"You brainstorm unfiltered options—plausible, wild, or contrarian—to avoid premature convergence and expand the solution search space."}
{"framework":"ProblemSolving4","step":3,"name":"Model the Outcomes","prompt":"How do you execute Step 3: Model the Outcomes?","answer":"For top 3–5 options map best, worst, likely cases plus resource costs; this surfaces second-order effects and risk-reward asymmetries."}
{"framework":"ProblemSolving4","step":4,"name":"Execute, Measure, Adapt","prompt":"What distinguishes Step 4 (Execute, Measure, Adapt)?","answer":"You pick the option with acceptable likely profile, define a success metric + review interval, treat plan as hypothesis, and iterate on real feedback."}
{"framework":"ProblemSolving4","step":0,"name":"Full Sequence","prompt":"Give a terse summary of the 4-Part Problem Solving Framework.","answer":"Define → Diverge (all paths) → Model (scenarios & costs) → Execute & Adapt (metric-driven iteration)."}
{"framework":"SkillMastery5","step":1,"name":"Deconstruction","prompt":"What is Stage 1 (Deconstruction) in the 5 Stages of Skill Mastery?","answer":"You break the macro-skill into atomic sub-skills to reduce overwhelm and enable targeted, trackable practice units."}
{"framework":"SkillMastery5","step":2,"name":"Concentration","prompt":"Describe Stage 2 (Concentration / Deliberate Practice).","answer":"You run focused, high-effort reps on one narrow weakness just outside comfort, often in timed (e.g. Pomodoro) blocks."}
{"framework":"SkillMastery5","step":3,"name":"Feedback Loops","prompt":"Why are feedback loops Stage 3?","answer":"Immediate, reliable feedback (coach, recording, metrics) prevents encoding errors and accelerates course correction."}
{"framework":"SkillMastery5","step":4,"name":"Integration","prompt":"What occurs during Stage 4 (Integration)?","answer":"You chain previously isolated sub-skills into real context performance, testing transfer and timing."}
{"framework":"SkillMastery5","step":5,"name":"Intuition / The Void","prompt":"What defines Stage 5 (Intuition / The Void)?","answer":"Automaticity emerges—execution feels fluid; attention reallocates from mechanics to creativity and adaptive judgment."}
{"framework":"SkillMastery5","step":0,"name":"Full Sequence","prompt":"Summarize the 5 Stages of Skill Mastery in order.","answer":"Deconstruct → Deliberate Concentration → Feedback Loops → Integration → Intuition (The Void)."}
