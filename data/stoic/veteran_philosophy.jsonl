{"theme":"order_vs_chaos","prompt":"How does a soldier reconcile strict discipline with the chaos of battle?","answer":"By internalizing structure (drill, hierarchy, standard operating procedures) as a stable cognitive scaffold while flexibly adapting perception and micro‑decisions to fluid threat cues—discipline supplies a decision baseline; adaptability rides on top."}
{"theme":"mission_purpose","prompt":"What does a mission mindset contribute to personal philosophy?","answer":"It reframes abstract virtue into executable intent: define objective, constraints, resources, after‑action learning loop—turning 'live a good life' into operational cycles of clarity, action, debrief, refinement."}

{"theme":"nancy_sherman","prompt":"How does Nancy Sherman extend Stoicism to moral injury?","answer":"She maps ancient practices (premeditatio, role duty, cognitive distancing) onto healing protocols for shame, betrayal, and value dissonance, updating Stoic resilience with trauma‑informed compassion."}
