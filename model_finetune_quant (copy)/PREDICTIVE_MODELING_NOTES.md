# Predictive Modeling Notes

Focus Areas:

*   Time series forecasting (NeuralProphet).  
*   Feature engineering pipeline standardization.  
*   Cross-validation for temporal splits.  
*   Lag features + rolling aggregates.  
*   Model registry approach (lightweight JSON manifest).  
*   Experiment tracking stub (could integrate later with MLflow).
